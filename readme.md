# My Personal Website

ðŸ”— https://sebastiandedeyne.com

I'm open sourcing this because I don't see any reason not to.

## Specs & Features

- Built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) 5.6
- Content is stored in markdown files with front matter, which are parsed with my own [`spatie/sheets`](https://github.com/spatie/sheets) package
- Assets are built with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). JavaScript is transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), CSS with [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) & [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- I'm using [Envoy](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/envoy) for zero downtime deployments
- The live site is hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) droplet, provisioned with [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com)
