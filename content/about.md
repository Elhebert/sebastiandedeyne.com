I'm a full-stack developer working at Spatie in Antwerp, Belgium. I spend most of my time writing PHP and javascript.

In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, watching good TV like The Wire, cooking good food (anything with pasta!), and listening to good music while cherishing my vinyl collection.
